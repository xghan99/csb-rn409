## About the project

Goalie is a web-based solution that seeks to help people keep track of their finances and be in track of their finances through the following methods: 
1. allowing users to set a savings goal
2. allowing users to keep track of their expenses and income 
3. allowing users to keep track of their investments (coming soon!)
This is part of the module CP2106 Independent Software Development, also known as Orbital.
