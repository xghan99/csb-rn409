Figure 6: Click on Dashboard

Set a savings goal by entering your savings goal **(for the current month)** (Figure 7). Then, simply press set (Figure 8). Your savings goal should be reflected on the page immediately. *Note: Saving Goal cannot be negative.*

Figure 8: Click “Set” and your savings goal will be reflected.

Now, having set a goal, it is time to achieve it. Start [keeping track of your expenses and income](#4-track-your-expenses-and-income).

### 4. Track Your Expenses and Income
Get started by navigating to the Income & Expenditure page. This is accessible from the navigation bar (Figure 9).

![](public/user-guide-pictures/figure9.png)\
Figure 9: Navigate to Income & Expenditure

#### 4a. Adding an Expense

By default, you are able to add an expense. In the form, indicate the date of expense, a short description of the expense, amount, category, and whether the expense was a need or a want (Figure 10).

<a name="rule"> Note: All fields have to be filled in with valid input (No future dates, purely numerical descriptions, or non-positive amounts are allowed). </a>

Currently, our expense categories are “Food & Drink”, “Entertainment”, “Others”.

Not sure whether your expense was a need or want? Refer to this [link](https://www.makingsenseofcents.com/2017/06/wants-and-needs.html) for more information.

![](public/user-guide-pictures/figure10.png)\
Figure 10: Add an expense by filling in the details

Next, click the “add” button. Your expense should appear on the Expense and Income Table below (Figure 11).

![](public/user-guide-pictures/figure11.png)\
Figure 11: Expenses and Income Table

#### 4b. Adding an Income

If you want to add an income instead, simply toggle the Income button and the form will change to one that will allow you to add an income (Figure 12). Add the needed details accordingly.

*The **[rules](#rule)** for adding an expense apply here as well.*

![](public/user-guide-pictures/figure12.png)\
Figure 12: Toggle the income button. Notice that the form changes (Why? Because Income cannot be categorized as “need” or “want”)

Click the “Add” button and it will be recorded in the Expenses and Income table (Figure 13).

![](public/user-guide-pictures/figure13.png)\
Figure 13: Once “Add” is clicked, the income will be reflected in the table below

### 7. Resetting filters
Filters can be reset by selecting the original state of the desired dropdown.

For example:
1. If I want to reset my “Month” filter to show all months, I should choose “Month” from the dropdown (Figures 34-35)
2. If I want to reset my “Category” filter to show all categories, I should choose “Category” from the dropdown (Figures 36-37)

![](public/user-guide-pictures/figure34.png)\
Figure 34: Currently in “07”, showing July Expenses

![](public/user-guide-pictures/figure35.png)\
Figure 35: Reset the month filter by choosing “Month” in the dropdown and all expenses will be shown
![](public/user-guide-pictures/figure36.png)\
Figure 36: Currently in “Entertainment”, showing Expenses of category “Entertainment”

![](public/user-guide-pictures/figure37.png)\
Figure 37: Reset the category filter by choosing “Category” in the dropdown and all expenses will be shown

Furthermore, when toggling through “All”, “Expense” and “Income”, it is guaranteed that all filters will be reset.

For example, If I am currently viewing Expenses in the month of July, with the category “Food & Drink”, once I toggle over to “Income”, I will be viewing all Income with no filters applied.

### 8. Viewing the Dashboard: Descriptive Statistics

*This section will not be helpful if you have not set a savings goal or have not tracked your expenses and income. Find out more about **[setting a savings goal](#3-set-a-savings-goal)**, or find out more about **[tracking your expenses and income ](#4-track-your-expenses-and-income)*

*Also, take note that all descriptive statistics are for the **current month**.*

To view the dashboard, simply navigate to the dashboard by clicking on “Dashboard” in the navigation bar. Goalie shows you two kinds of descriptive statistics (for now):

#### 8a. Breakdown

Goalie aggregates your want expenses, need expenses, and total expenses for the current month. View them under “Breakdown” (Figure 38).

![](public/user-guide-pictures/figure38.png)\
Figure 38: An example of a breakdown of expenses under breakdown

#### 8b. Need and Want Pie Chart

Goalie helps you segregate and aggregate your expenses by whether they are a need expense or a want expense. You can very quickly find out your total want expenses and need expenses for the month and their relative proportion of the total expenses for the month by referring to the need and want pie chart in the dashboard (Figure 39).

![](public/user-guide-pictures/figure39.png)\
Figure 39: An example of a need and want expense pie chart. (Clearly, I have been spending a lot less on wants than needs, which is ideal!)

### 9. Viewing the Dashboard: Analysis 

Goalie evaluates your spending habits and savings goal to determine how much you can afford to spend for the day.

It will also tell you on average, how much money you have been spending per day.

Lastly, Goalie will keep you on track to achieve your savings goal by making recommendations based on your spending habits.
